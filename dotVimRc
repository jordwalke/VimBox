" See `README.md` for features and shortcuts
" Additional features not mentioned in README:
"
" Spell Check:
" Command+shift+p to toggle spell check on comments (underlines in red).
"
" Mac ProTips:
"  To further improve the text rendering on Mac OSX:
"  1. From the shell: defaults write org.vim.MacVim MMCellWidthMultiplier 0.9
"  2. Opens all files from other apps in vert split defaults write
"  org.vim.MacVim MMVerticalSplit YES
"  3. If when changing monitors, your fonts go from nice and thin to ugly and
"  bold: This should fix it:
"   defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 1
"  4. Speed up full screen transition:
"  defaults write org.vim.MacVim MMFullScreenFadeTime 0.05
"
" Cygwin:
" Tested and should work. AutoHotkey exist that provide an identical experience
" to the Mac OSX experience.
"
" Bundle System:
" =================================================================
" Uses the VimPlug system. Add bundles to ~/.vim/bundlesVimRc with:
" Plug "githubUser/repo"
" Open a new window and then run `:PlugInstall`
" Close and then reopen the vim window.

" Performance Profiling:
" ========================
" http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12213597/how-to-see-which-plugins-are-making-vim-slow
"
" Find Slow Plugins During Actions:
" =================================
"
"   :profile start profile.log
"   :profile func *
"   :profile file *
"   " At this point do slow actions
"   :profile pause
"   :noautocmd qall!
"
" Profile Startup Time:
" ==================================================================
"   mvim --startuptime ~/.vim/timeCost.txt ~/.vim/timeCost.txt
"
" Debugging VimSript Errors:
" ==================================================================
" Ever have this happen to you?
"
"    Error <SNR>49_Destroy[10]...Line 3
"
" This is Vim's idea of a good error message (when one of your plugin throws
" an error). See that weird <SNR>49? That's the script number which is
" assigned to the VimScript file behind the scenes (invisibly to you) - Here's
" how you find out which script that is. Execute :scriptnames and find the
" corresponding number in that list.  So <SNR>49 means script number 49, and
" Destroy, UnsetIMap are the last two functions in the stack trace (so the
" problem is ultimately in UnsetIMap in my case).  And that "line 3"?  That's
" not the line number in the file like any reasonable error message would
" display that's the line number within the deepest function.

" Seeing Who Is Setting A Setting:
" =================================================================
" :verbose set settingName?

" Using In Terminal
" ================
" Using VimBox in your terminal is semi-supported. It should work, but it is
" not tested often. If you see something off, please report but a PR is
" the best way to move VimBox forward with terminal support.
"
" Note: If you use iTerm, and you want airline symbols to show up correctly
" you must change the font in *two* places in iTerm. The normal font, and the
" non-ascii font!

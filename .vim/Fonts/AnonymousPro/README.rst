Anonymous Pro (2009) is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed
especially with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for
one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them
easier to tell apart in the context of source code.

Anonymice Powerline is derived from Anonymous Pro for Powerline users.
The Powerline symbols is being made by Kim Silkeb√¶kken. The patch work
is being undertaken by Carl X. Su.
